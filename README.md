Project Goal:
Build a machine learning system that predicts the risk of early-onset metabolic diseases (like Type 2 diabetes or hypertension) using:
Wearable sensor data (steps, HR, sleep, activity intensity)
Self-reported lifestyle data (diet, stress, mood, hydration, smoking)
Basic demographic and family history
Provide personalized risk scores, interpret why, and offer actionable lifestyle adjustments.
